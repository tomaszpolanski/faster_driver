## 0.1.1
* Adding possibility to only aggregate test files from a specific folder

## 0.1.0
* [MINOR BREAKING CHANGE] Sorting created imports and test name by name to have consistent order between platforms.
This is a breaking changes as the observed behavior changes

## 0.0.3+2
* Due to limitations of some dockerized CI systems that cannot handle complex
arguments with `""`, you can pass complex argument concatenated with `,,,`

## 0.0.3+1
* Better logging when mismatching arguments

## 0.0.3
* Allowing passing arguments and templates

In case you want to pass specific arguments to your tests, now you can do it.
You can specify the template of `main_tests.dart` file by passing the template file
via the `--template` option. An example of template could look like this:
```dart
#{{main-body}} =   {{import-name}}.main(args);
// ignore_for_file: directives_ordering
/// This file is autogenerated and should not be committed
/// to source control
import 'package:integration_test/integration_test.dart';
import 'package:test_utils/test_utils.dart';
{{imports}}

void main() {
  final List<String> args = {{arguments}};
  IntegrationTestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
{{main-body}}
}
```
The `{{main-body}}` is a list of your test files and on the top of the file
you declare how one line should look like - in this case we are passing `args`
to every test file so it could use the arguments that we passed to
`fasterdriver` via `--test-args` option.
